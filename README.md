# boatmonitor
Monitoring battery status and location. This repository contains the IBM Bluemix files for the project. The project uses a SODAQ One with the location tracker Arduino code as a base. The data is send using LoRaWAN to The Things Network (TTN) published the sensor data on a MQTT topic. In Bluemix a Nodered flow is configured that listens for that topic and stores the data in Cloudant. On Cloudant two views will list a summary of all sensors and the history of data. Another Nodered flow defines two API that are publicly available to listen query the data in Cloudant. An HTML5 application will display the information (using d3.js for visualizing graphs).
